for encryption&decryption - md5
MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a well-known cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit 
resulting hash value. MD5 is widely used in security-related applications, and is also frequently used to check the integrity of files.

for compress&decompress - 
zlib.deflate (compression) and zlib.inflate (decompression) are implementations of the compression methods described in 
RFC 1951. The deflate filter takes up to three parameters passed as an associative array. 
level describes the compression strength to use (1-9). Higher numbers will generally yield smaller payloads at 
the cost of additional processing time. Two special compression levels also exist: 0 (for no compression at all), and -1 
(zlib internal default -- currently 6).
